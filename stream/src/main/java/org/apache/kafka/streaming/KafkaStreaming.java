/**
 * Kafka Streaming allows for performing continuous computation on input coming from one or more input topics and
 * sends output to zero or more output topics.
 * <p>
 * This processing is defined by extending the {@link TopologyBuilder} abstract class to specify the transformation operator build. The
 * {@link KafkaStreaming} instance will be responsible for the lifecycle of these processors. It will instantiate and
 * start one or more of these processors to process the Kafka partitions assigned to this particular instance.
 * <p>
 * This streaming instance will co-ordinate with any other instances (whether in this same process, on other processes
 * on this machine, or on remote machines). These processes will divide up the work so that all partitions are being
 * consumed. If instances are added or die, the corresponding {@link StreamThread} instances will be shutdown or
 * started in the appropriate processes to balance processing load.
 * <p>
 * Internally the {@link KafkaStreaming} instance contains a normal {@link org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer KafkaProducer}
 * and {@link org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer KafkaConsumer} instance that is used for reading input and writing output.
 * <p>
 * A simple example might look like this:
 * <pre>
 *    Properties props = new Properties();
 *    props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:4242");
 *    properties config = new properties(props);
 *    config.processor(ExampleStreamProcessor.class);
 *    config.serialization(new StringSerializer(), new StringDeserializer());
 *    KafkaStreaming container = new KafkaStreaming(new MyKStreamTopology(), config);
 *    container.run();
 * </pre>
